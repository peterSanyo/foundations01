Hand-In 1/5
idea for a project by Péter Sanyó

GLASS CURTAIN

I think about working on an online Gallery which displays a limited amount of objects for a limited amount of time, then reshapes itself over and over. 
5 Objects displayed for two weeks.
These objects can only be bought within this timeframe.

Buying options:
    - Either direct contact to seller
    or
    - Auction Method. The 5 highest bids with a personal letter from the bidders will be presented to the seller who then chooses. 

Gallery-Cyclus:
    After 2 Weeks the current 5 Objects will be deleted from the gallery and after the weekend on monday the next gallery with 5 new objects will be presented. This cyclus continues. 

The nature of the products should vary. Design furniture, art pieces, signed objects, Limited editions, unique pieces, once-in-a-lifetime-experiences.
The pieces should arouse great emotional value to enthusiasts.
For example: 
- A woren outfit specially tailored for an actor/actress from a well known movie. 
- Hand-Crafted furniture designs, preferrably limited editions or exclusive releases. 
- Signed Albums, Vynils, LPs, Cards, Games, Objects.
- A single-person-exclusive tour through the backhalls of a art-restorer-department of the national gallery in Berlin. (Game-Company, Sports-Club etc.)
- Locally-Exclusive Fashion releases. (Tours, exhibitions etc.) 

Look:
    The concept of the project should be relatively simplistic, yet visually significant.
    Each object gets its own dedicated page-view. Store-Window-like.
    - Content: Images, Videos 
    - Context: Further content provided by seller (Video?, soundbites? or just simple text?)
    - Composition: measures, materials, localities etc.. 
    - Connect: 1.) Possible Contact to Seller 2.) Form to send in bids and letters 

The person operating the project should be able to pre-curate the following exhibitions.
Add pieces, add content.

Just a thought, would love to have a talk about that.
